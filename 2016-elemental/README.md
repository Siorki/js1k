My entry "Art in '92" to js1k 2016

She started dancing almost a quarter century ago ! Tribute to a demo that redefined the Amiga scene back then.

------

The referenced demo is the outstanding [State of the Art](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=99) released by Spaceballs at The Party 1992.
Of course only a tiny fraction of it could be crammed in 1k. I extracted four vector images from the original, downsampled them to 28 points and animated them over 14 frames.
Spice with hypnotic circle patterns, faking a bitplane effect through canvas composite operations (unfortunately too slow to maintain 30 fps on Chrome, Opera and Safari).
Top with music, [original melody](http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=39162) by Travolta, drumloop evolved from [generative work](http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=8357&page=19) by mu6k. 
Serve with animation synced to the music.
